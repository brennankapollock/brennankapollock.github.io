    <h2>about brennan</h2>
        <p>after years pursuing a career in academia and the church as an episcopal priest i realized that path
        wasn't for me. while my studies in philosophy and theology still excite me i needed another direction to
        place my intellectual yearnings. that's how i reconnected with my love of tech, gaming, and computer science.
        i get to collaborate and craft products with others similar to how an architect and their carpenters construct a house from the 
        ground up. the possibilities are seemingly endless and that's enough to put me behind the keys everyday.</p>

        <h4>i also have other interests outside of programming:</h4>
